The only change I made is finetune.ipynb code, other code describing the model and define other methods are made by the original auther.
Besides, my dataset is obtained from Hugging Face, the loading part I did in finetune.ipynb file. 
Another dataset I used to validate is Sentences_AllAgree.txt, I have uploaded into my repo.
